# alice-sys

This crate contains the [bindgen](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rust-bindgen) generated bindings to a c++ object which reads the data from disk.

The c++ class is automatically generated by ROOT's `TTree::MakeClass` function specifically for the Event-Summary-Data (ESD) data format at hand.
I disabled the majority of the unneeded columns (branches) in the `c++` files. I would love to be able to enable/disable branches from the Rust side. I am toying with the idea of having some sort of a macro which enables specific branches and then implements a trait to access them. Alternatively, it would be awesome to actually do the IO in pure rust using `nom`, but that seems far away at this point.

**The compilation of this crate requires a ROOT 6 installation.**
